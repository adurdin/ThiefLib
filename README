ThiefLib is a modern wrapper library for creating custom script modules for the
Dark Engine games Thief II: The Metal Age and Thief: The Dark Project/Thief
Gold. It builds on the previous work of GayleSaver and Telliamed in documenting
the engine's often-perplexing script API while offering a simplified, modern-C++
interface in which the first-class objects and methods are coherently organized
and clearly mapped to in-game results.

ThiefLib is still in development and should be used with caution. It is the base
library for KDScript as of version 0.7.0 of that module, but many elements not
used there have not seen extensive testing. See the TODO file and comments
marked TODO throughout the codebase for other work remaining to be done.
Particularly, the library is still almost entirely undocumented.

The library currently requires NewDark, but that dependency can be made
conditional if desired.
