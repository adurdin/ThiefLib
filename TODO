Current
	* Replace Parameter<Object> with Parameter<Object::Ref>, resolvable dynamically to an Object.
	* Fix possible dangling pointer in posted or scheduled synthetic QuestMessage and ObjectiveMessage instances.
	* Promote LGMultiTypeError to something public, documenting it and the general LGMulti system (without actually exposing LGMulti).

Novel messages/wrappers
	* HierarchyMessage: ITraitManager::Listen (per DH2)
	* ObjectMessage: IObjectSystem::Listen (per DH2)
	* ParameterMessage: from ParameterCache activity

TNH/NV/TW features
	* ParameterCache: NVScript-style syntax (script name prefix, object targetting)
	* QuestVariable: message substitutions per cQVarText et al.
	* QuestVariable: reference syntax parsing per cQVarProcessor, TWBaseScript, et al.
	* TrapTrigger: requirement counting per cRequirement
	* TrapTrigger: NVScript-style features (on, off, count, capacitor, falloff, failchance, dest)

Other
	* Document undocumented units: AI, ActReact, Combat, Physics, Player, Rendering, Security, Sound, Tweq, Types.
	* Document the template and various accessory files, such as version.rc and module.mk.
	* Add more general documentation including examples.
	* Recheck NewDark modders' notes for any missed fields.
	* AI, Types: split each into two or more units.
	* EnumCoding: support encoding and decoding of bitmasks.
	* Objective: add VictoryCheck(er)-equivalent functionality per <lg/convict.h>.
	* Use C++11 features added in G++ 4.8 once MinGW-w64 is upgraded (including {map,multimap,set}::emplace).
	* Use boost::bimap once 1.55 is released (supporting initializer_list).
