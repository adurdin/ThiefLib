This directory contains a basic template for a Dark Engine custom script module
using the ThiefLib wrapper library. (See the library's README file in the parent
directory for more information on it.)

A single "Hello World" demonstration script, SampleScript, has been included. To
use this template:
* replace the SampleScript with your own scripts
* edit the lines marked CUSTOMIZE in Makefile, module.cc, and version.rc
* edit the first line of exports.def
